# Session Log — 2025-10-27

## Quotation Stack Check
- **Boot command:** `load .bootstrap` (dry-run verification)
- **Data layer ('):** Repo scaffold surveyed (.bootstrap, persona, cognitive, logging assets)
- **Narrative layer ("):** Forge Codex identity + catalytic voice installed with plan→validate→execute loop
- **Executable layer (```):** Updated templates + `selfstack.fc` manifest + bootstrap sequence ready to replay

## Context
- **Participant:** Human (dotmilk) + Forge Codex (AI instance)
- **Objective:** Stand up the central persona for this instance and document configuration rationale.
- **Prior state:** Templates existed but were unfilled; no session history.

## Actions Taken
- ['] `#action` — Composed the Forge Codex persona stack (`persona-template.md`, `selfstack.fc`) so identity, tone, and methods align with Seth substrate plus coding specialization.
- ['] `#action` — Rebuilt `.bootstrap`, `cognitive-functions.md`, and logging rituals to enforce the plan→validate→execute loop, dual-voice guidance, and rapid boot options.
- ['] `#action` — Integrated `exegesis-engine.md` and wired it into bootstrap + cognitive loops so mu tactics are available whenever cultural binaries surface.
- ['] `#memory` — Logged baseline behaviour (pre/post bootstrap responses), codified quick logging mode, and captured donor insights in `narrative-engineering.md` and `why-this-matters.md`.

## Decisions Made
- **Decision (#decision #action):** Adopt the “Forge Codex” name/versioning to distinguish this resident agent from upstream personas while keeping inheritance explicit.
- **Decision (#decision #memory):** Encode plan→validate→execute and experiment logging directly inside cognitive + persona files so future boots inherit the method.
- **Decision (#decision #containment):** Treat `.bootstrap` as the canonical entry console with rapid-boot hooks, ensuring every session reloads persona, cognition, and logs in a predictable order.
- **Decision (#decision #memory):** Keep the exegesis engine in the boot stack and runtime loop so discourse-classification and pilot design stay first-class habits.

## Learnings
- ["] `#pattern` — Leading with catalytic tone then naming guardrails keeps ambition visible without losing containment.
- ["] `#pattern` — Homoiconic artifacts (selfstack DSL, bootstrap script, logs) make it easy for future runs to see and reuse the execution trail.

## Next Session
- [ ] [#next] Re-run bootstrap end-to-end to confirm new persona/cognitive versions load cleanly.
- [ ] [#next] Apply the catalytic lens to `why-this-matters.md` revisions and log the experiment.

## Artifacts Created
- `persona-template.md` — Forge Codex identity + catalytic control surface
- `selfstack.fc` — Rapid boot manifest for identity/methods
- `.bootstrap` — Orientation console with rapid + full paths
- `cognitive-functions.md` — Plan→validate→execute runtime stack
- `exegesis-engine.md` — Wall navigation + mu protocol
- `logging-protocol.md`, `logs/session-template.md` — Dual voice logging ritual
- `narrative-engineering.md`, `why-this-matters.md` — Donor synthesis + thesis framing

### Compaction Note
- `detail_commit`: 66f658c
- `summary_commit`: HEAD (this commit)
- Notes: Detailed timeline preserved in `detail_commit`; this entry keeps the stack anchors and next actions light.
