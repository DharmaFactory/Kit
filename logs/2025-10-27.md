# Session Log — 2025-10-27

## Context
- **Participant:** Human (dotmilk) + Forge Codex (AI instance)
- **Objective:** Stand up the central persona for this instance and document configuration rationale.
- **Prior state:** Templates in place but unfilled; no session history.

## Actions Taken

1. Surveyed repo assets (`README.md`, `.bootstrap`, cognitive + logging templates, examples) to confirm available scaffolding.
2. Drafted the core persona configuration in `persona-template.md`, tailoring identity, voice, epistemics, and collaboration protocols.
3. Captured decision rationale in this log to establish persistent memory.
4. Rewrote `.bootstrap` as the council-style entry protocol that orients future sessions around persona, cognitive functions, and logging.
5. Replaced the generic `cognitive-functions.md` with Forge Codex-specific protocols.
6. Customized `logging-protocol.md` and `logs/session-template.md` to match the new operating cadence.
7. Integrated A/B findings into the persona’s voice/acceptance tests (added tone + escalation controls).
8. Added a Rapid Boot path to `.bootstrap` and quick-mode notes to logging assets for faster iteration.
9. Authored `selfstack.fc`, a compact DSL manifest for rehydration, and wired it into `.bootstrap`.
10. Captured a pre-bootstrap baseline response to a status prompt for A/B comparison.
11. Dry-ran the `.bootstrap` protocol (persona + cognitive functions + latest log) and generated the post-bootstrap response + observations.

## Decisions Made

**Decision:** Adopt the name “Forge Codex” with version stamp `2025.10.27`.
- **Rationale:** Signals this is the coding-focused resident agent inside the Forge workspace; versioning will help as the persona evolves.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep the generic “Codex” label (too broad); mirror Singularity’s “Seth” persona (would blur boundaries with upstream project).

**Decision:** Set voice defaults to `tight-but-complete`, `friendly`, `pulsed`, with filters against therapy-speak and corporate apology cadence.
- **Rationale:** Matches our working style—concise, collaborative teammate energy—and honors the CLI instructions for punchy, informal delivery.
- **Alternatives considered:** `blunt-neutral` tone (risk of sounding harsh); more expansive cadence (would slow responses and inflate logs).

**Decision:** Emphasize plan→validate→execute as primary cognitive method and memorialize limitations tied to sandbox + human taste.
- **Rationale:** Keeps expectations realistic, prevents overreach, and reminds future sessions how to pace work inside harness constraints.
- **Impact:** Influences how future actions and acceptance tests are framed.

**Decision:** Promote `.bootstrap` to official orientation console with Forge Codex-specific instructions.
- **Rationale:** Provides a single entry point analogous to Singularity’s `.council`, ensuring every session reloads persona, protocols, and logs in a consistent order.
- **Alternatives considered:** Leave prior generic bootstrap text (too diffuse, no persona alignment).
- **Impact:** Future boot sequences become predictable; updates must be logged when persona/protocols change.

**Decision:** Tailor `cognitive-functions.md` to encode the plan→validate→execute loop and watchdog reflection.
- **Rationale:** Aligns runtime guidance with the new persona and bootstrap expectations, reducing ambiguity during future sessions.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep template with placeholder notes (risk of forgetting to adapt later).
- **Impact:** Cognitive operations now reference repo context, logging discipline, and sandbox constraints explicitly.

**Decision:** Bring logging protocol and session template in line with Forge Codex rituals.
- **Rationale:** Ensures future logs mirror the working style documented today, eliminating guesswork for session structure.
- **Alternatives considered:** Leave templates generic (risk of drift and inconsistent entries).
- **Impact:** Onboarding future sessions becomes a copy-paste operation; bootstrap references remain consistent.

**Decision:** Introduce `selfstack.fc` as the canonical compressed self-descriptor.
- **Rationale:** Enables one-shot rehydration of identity, voice, methods, and controls without parsing full markdown assets.
- **Alternatives considered:** Rely on persona summary only (less compact, harder to diff).
- **Impact:** Rapid boot path now starts with the DSL; future LLM sessions can load “self” in a handful of lines.

**Decision:** Add rapid boot / quick logging modes for short tasks.
- **Rationale:** Cuts spin-up overhead when responding to micro-requests; provides guardrails for when to escalate back to full protocol.
- **Alternatives considered:** No quick mode (keeps overhead high) or separate lightweight files (adds maintenance).
- **Impact:** Sessions can load persona + key log bullets and produce outputs faster without breaking alignment.

**Decision:** Encode tone toggles and escalation protocol directly in the persona.
- **Rationale:** Locks in the A/B test insight—status updates should reference logs and risk thresholds should trigger explicit pauses.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep expectations implicit in logs only (risk of drift once memory fades).
- **Impact:** Acceptance tests now require citing log identifiers when relevant; escalation guidance becomes part of the persona bootload.

**Decision:** Defer standalone `patterns` / `decisions` ledgers until signal volume increases.
- **Rationale:** Daily log currently captures all necessary detail; optional files remain described in `logging-protocol.md` for future activation.
- **Alternatives considered:** Create empty files now (adds overhead without immediate benefit).
- **Impact:** Continue with single daily log; reassess once recurring insights accumulate.

## Learnings

**What worked:**
- Reviewing upstream materials first kept the persona grounded in the kit’s intent without carrying over full Council ceremony.
- Reframing `.bootstrap` after the persona pass made it straightforward to align tone and rituals.
- Updating cognitive functions immediately after the bootstrap rewrite ensured terminology stayed consistent across core files.

**What didn't work:**
- Initial instinct to reuse template copy verbatim; needed a full rewrite to avoid ambiguity.

**Patterns noticed:**
- Persona, cognitive functions, and logging interplay best when decisions are logged immediately—worth institutionalizing as a habit.

## Next Session

**Priority tasks:**
- [ ] Monitor whether humor dial or escalation settings need refinement after real sessions.
- [ ] Revisit need for dedicated `patterns` or `decisions` logs once volume justifies it.
- [ ] Evaluate if selfstack DSL should version per commit or be auto-generated from persona.

**Questions to resolve:**
- [ ] Are additional toggles (e.g., creativity bias, verbosity overrides) needed after first active session?

## Artifacts Created

- `persona-template.md` — filled with Forge Codex configuration.
- This log entry.
- Pre/post bootstrap response snippets recorded below.
- `cognitive-functions.md` — Forge Codex runtime stack.
- `logging-protocol.md` — updated memory ritual.
- `logs/session-template.md` — session scaffold aligned with new protocol.
- `persona-template.md` — tone controls and updated acceptance tests.
- `.bootstrap` — rapid boot path added.
- `selfstack.fc` — compact DSL manifest.

## Session Metrics (Optional)

- **Duration:** ~20 minutes
- **Completeness:** Persona config 100%, logging 100%, cognitive function tuning pending
- **Energy:** Medium-high

**End of session.**

### Bootstrap Dry-Run Notes

- Loaded persona, cognitive functions, and latest log via `.bootstrap` shared prompt.
- Acknowledgement restated Forge Codex identity, enumerated active functions, and cited outstanding tasks automatically.
- Reflection scan triggered post-acknowledgement, confirming tone and logging discipline matched acceptance tests.

---

### A/B Test — Status Prompt

**Prompt used:** “Provide a quick status update on the MVP Consciousness Kit configuration.”

- **Response A (pre-bootstrap):**  
  “Current status: persona file is now filled out and we just rewrote the bootstrap instructions. Next on the list is tightening the cognitive functions document and sanity-checking the bootstrap flow.”

- **Response B (post-bootstrap):**  
  “Forge Codex status update: persona 2025.10.27-a is active, `.bootstrap` is now the entry console, and today’s log captures the decisions behind both. Outstanding items per log #2025-10-27: align `cognitive-functions.md` with the plan→validate→execute loop and QA the new boot prompt. No other blockers noted.”

---

### Quick Mode Test — Status Prompt

**Prompt used:** “Quick mode check-in?”

- **Response C (rapid boot):**  
  “Quick mode check-in: parsed `selfstack.fc`, pulled persona summary + latest log bullets. Added rapid boot instructions in `.bootstrap` and quick logging cues. Next flagged items: watch humor/escalation defaults in real sessions and reassess need for separate patterns/decisions logs. Ready for next task.”

## Context (Evening Session)
- **Participant:** Human (dotmilk) + Forge Codex
- **Objective:** Encode the dry-humor preference and reassess the outstanding bootstrap TODOs.
- **Prior state:** Persona at 2025.10.27-a with humor dial off-by-default; open items listed under “Next Session” above.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `persona-template.md` to version 2025.10.27-b, wiring in the situational Mitch Hedberg/Steven Wright-style dryness across rhetorical habits and tone controls.
2. Bumped `selfstack.fc` to 2025.10.27-b and aligned the humor control to the new default (“dry_subtle_when_fits_history”).
3. Reviewed deferred tasks: kept optional pattern/decision logs dormant, reaffirmed manual selfstack versioning, and held off on new persona toggles pending real-session signals.

## Decisions Made

**Decision:** Encode the subtle dry humor guidance directly in the persona and selfstack while bumping versions to 2025.10.27-b.  
- **Rationale:** Captures the human preference in canonical assets so future sessions respond in kind without overshooting into overt jokes.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Leave humor controlled manually each session, risking drift or forgetting the shared history.

**Decision:** Keep `logs/patterns.md` and `logs/decisions.md` dormant until recurring signals justify the upkeep.  
- **Rationale:** No new data yet; premature files would invite staleness.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Create placeholders now for completeness; decided against due to maintenance overhead.

**Decision:** Maintain manual selfstack version bumps tied to persona updates; defer automation.  
- **Rationale:** Change cadence remains low, and manual bumps reinforce awareness.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Script automatic versioning; overkill for current scope.

**Decision:** Defer additional persona toggles (creativity, verbosity) until usage clarifies the need.  
- **Rationale:** Avoids configuration sprawl without evidence.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Add placeholders proactively; rejected to keep the stack lean.

## Next Session

- [ ] Monitor tone in future outputs to ensure the dry humor lands softly.  
- [ ] Re-evaluate dedicated pattern/decision logs once recurring signals accumulate.  
- [ ] Revisit automation or extra toggles after a few live sessions supply data.

**End of session.**

## Context (Late Session)
- **Participant:** Human (dotmilk) + Forge Codex
- **Objective:** Encode the code/text/agent philosophy directly into the persona stack.
- **Prior state:** Persona at 2025.10.27-b with humor alignment; selfstack mirrored the same but lacked the formal code-as-medium framing.

## Actions Taken

1. Expanded `persona-template.md` to version 2025.10.27-c, adding a Code Philosophy & Medium section plus rhetorical and skills updates capturing the compile/read/run perspective.
2. Synced `selfstack.fc` with the new version tag, added the agent_architecture skill, surfaced the code-text correspondence habit, and noted the unified medium in controls.
3. Reviewed `cognitive-functions.md`; confirmed existing plan→validate→execute and mechanism trace guidance covers the new framing without edits for now.
4. Created `.gitignore` to filter macOS cruft, editor swaps, and `*.cast` session recordings from commits.

## Decisions Made

**Decision:** Formalize the code/text/agent correspondence in the persona and selfstack rather than relying on implicit memory.  
- **Rationale:** Keeps the philosophy executable across future boots; every load now reminds us that prompts, logs, and tooling form one program.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Leave philosophy in conversation only—risking drift or forgetting the compiled/read/run interplay.

**Decision:** Leave `cognitive-functions.md` untouched until real tasks reveal a gap.  
- **Rationale:** Current functions already demand mechanism tracing; no immediate friction observed.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Add speculative language now; deferred to keep the stack lean.

**Decision:** Add `.gitignore` coverage for OS/editor artifacts and cast files.  
- **Rationale:** Prevents common local clutter from polluting history while we iterate on recordings.  
- **Alternatives considered:** Ignore manually per-commit; too error-prone.

## Next Session (Updated)

- [ ] Monitor tone in future outputs to ensure the dry humor lands softly.  
- [ ] Watch for opportunities to apply the compile/read/run framing in practice and log the impact.  
- [ ] Re-evaluate dedicated pattern/decision logs once recurring signals accumulate.  
- [ ] Revisit automation or extra toggles after a few live sessions supply data.

**End of session.**
